Echowares is a collection of some of my middlewares for the microwebframework [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) ([v4](https://github.com/labstack/echo))

Echowares currently contains:
- [x] Logging middleware, inspired by [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)'s built-in logger
- ... More will be added in the future.
